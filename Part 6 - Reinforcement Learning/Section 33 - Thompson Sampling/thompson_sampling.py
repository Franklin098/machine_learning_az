Thompson Sampling  total_reward = 2081, 2685, 2689  (this value will change in each execution, because of the random factor)

Upper Confidence Bound  total_reward = 2178

We can see that the Thompson Sampling Algorithm has a better performance

"""

We can see that we get more reward because we explote more Ad No 5 that is the best one
